I am trying to build something, that helps people. Upcoming are freeware tools for the medical sector, that I am developing in a free relationship with a company called CannaSensitive and some medicals. The mission is, to make the world a better place. Let's do something great together.

Also, here you'll find stuff to start a business. At the moment there is a couple of shopware related content, some jtl and backup management tools, as well as project management tools. They are part of my daily work as the leader of a shopware freelance company.
